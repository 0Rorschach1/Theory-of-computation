To generate DFA visualizations, you'll need to have Graphviz installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up Graphviz:

1.Download Graphviz: Visit the Graphviz official website and download the appropriate version for your operating system: Graphviz Downloads

2.Install Graphviz: Install Graphviz on your system using the installer or package manager that corresponds to your operating system.

3.Add Graphviz to PATH: For the DFA visualization to work smoothly, make sure to add Graphviz to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows the tool to locate the Graphviz executable files.

4.With Graphviz properly installed and configured, you'll be able to generate PNG visualizations of DFAs using the tool. This visual representation can greatly aid in understanding the structure and transitions within the generated automata.

5.Feel free to consult the official Graphviz documentation for more detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting, if needed.
